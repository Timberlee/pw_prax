TODO

- Add baseurl to playwright.config.ts
- Add test for "Hello Wrold" h1
- Figure out syntax for actually validating hrefs (urls)
- Add image tests for working and broken images
- Add additional setTimeout element with variable timing (so it sometimes passes/fails)
- Clean up playwright.config.ts (too many comments; maybe have a default and an alternate)

Stretch goals:
- Add mock GDRP cookie banner and track page behavior / network request upon clicking (see that only the primary cookie is stored and additional ones are/aren't stored)
